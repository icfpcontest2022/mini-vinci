# mini-vinci-fe

Frontend implementation of mini-vinci featuring React and Material UI

### Getting Started

`node@16.13.1` and `yarn@1.22.18` are main dependencies. To manage multiple versions of node, 
you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). \
\
After making sure you're using correct versions, you can use following commands:\
\
Installing packages
```
yarn install
```
Launching the app locally
```
yarn start
```
To start the app on  a different port than 3000 (default), create a `.env` file (if it doesn't exist yet) 
and add the following line:
```
PORT={port}
```
